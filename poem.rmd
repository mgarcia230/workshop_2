A bowl of rose water dreams itself empty  
on the radiator: It's December and we can  
hardly afford the heat, our milk money  
crinkling hungry over the cold counter  
of our convenience store, the very last  
of our cash for creamer, for pleasantries,  
for cheap tea and cigarettes, for the barely-  
there scent of roses burning softly. We trade  
our hungers for hearth, for the clank and hiss  
of warmth. Small fires, these, but even we,  
in our clamorous poverty, demand pleasure:  
steal sugar, our neighbor's flowers, and never,  
ever are caught thankless in better weather.
